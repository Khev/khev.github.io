Here I'm keeping track of articles / news / links that I find interesting.

[**Seeing around corners**](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/04/seeing-around-corners/302471/) <br/>
This is a fantastic article on the power, purpose, and purview of modeling in the social sciences (and minimal models more generally). I really liked the line "The rise and refinement of artificial societies [i.e. minimal models] is not going to be a magic mirror, but it promises some hope of seeing, however dimly, around the next corner."


[**Letter to an aspiring intellectual**](https://www.firstthings.com/article/2018/05/letter-to-an-aspiring-intellectual) <br/>
"Your gaze is drawn, a flirtation begins, you learn more, you find some interlocutors, and, sometimes before you know it, your topic is before you and your intellectual course is set. There’s no algorithm for this: It’ll happen or it won’t."


[**De profundis**](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/921/921-h/921-h.htm) <br/> Oscar Wilde's 'love' letter to Bosie douglas when in jail. Long, but _very_ worth it.

[**Letter by Boltzmann**](https://homepage.univie.ac.at/Walter.Kutschera/Boltzmann_Reise%20ins%20Eldorado_English%20translation.pdf) <br/> A surprisingly personal and entertaining read


[**Web of stories**](https://www.webofstories.com/) <br/> A collection of interesting life stories

[**Attention networks**](https://skymind.ai/wiki/attention-mechanism-memory-network#rnn) <br/> A nice blog on the different types of NN


[**seq2seq tutorial keras**](https://machinelearningmastery.com/encoder-decoder-attention-sequence-to-sequence-prediction-keras/)
