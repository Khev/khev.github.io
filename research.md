Attaching sensors to crowd-sourced vehicles could provide a cheap and accurate way to monitor air pollution, road quality, and other aspects of a cityâ€™s health. [Here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10744) we analyze the 'sensing power' of taxis fleets in 9 major cities worldwide, and find an unexpectedly small number of taxis can scan a city.

**Swarmalators: oscillators that sync and swarm**

Synchronization occurs in many natural and technological systems, from cardiac pacemaker cells to coupled lasers. In the synchronized state, the individual cells or lasers coordinate the timing of their oscillations, but they do not move through space. A complementary form of self-organization occurs among swarming insects, flocking birds, or schooling fish; now the individuals move through space, but without conspicuously altering their internal states. 

Yet in some systems -- such as groups of sperm, Japanese tree frogs, and colloidal suspensions of magnetic particles -- self assembly and synchronization occur together. In this [project](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01190-3), we investigate the co-action of these twin forms of self-orgnaization. You can find a fun demo [here](http://usediscretion.blogspot.com/2017/01/the-swarmalator.html).

**Pulse coupled oscillators**

During every heartbeat, thousands of pacemaker cells discharge all-at-once. This collective firing causes the contraction of cardiac muscles, which pumps blood around the body. Should these firing fall out of step, heartbeats can become erratic, inhibiting blood flow. In order to maintain healthy heart function, the pacemaker cells must therefore forever maintain their synchronous firing. 

But how, precisely, do they do so? How do groups of cells stay organized enough to keep your heart beating? In this project, we try to figure this out -- see this [paper](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.064101) and this [paper](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.93.032203).
