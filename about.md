Kev is an applied mathematician. He did his doctoral work on complex systems under [Steve Strogatz](http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/) at Cornell. Now he's a postdoctoral fellow at the MIT [Senseable City Lab](http://senseable.mit.edu/) trying to understand how cities work, from a complex systems / data science / machine learning perspective.
