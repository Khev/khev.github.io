Here I'm keeping track of articles / news / links that I find interesting.

[**Seeing around corners**](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/04/seeing-around-corners/302471/) <br/>
This is a fantastic article on the power, purpose, and purview of modeling in the social sciences (and minimal models more generally). I really liked the line "The rise and refinement of artificial societies [i.e. minimal models] is not going to be a magic mirror, but it promises some hope of seeing, however dimly, around the next corner."
