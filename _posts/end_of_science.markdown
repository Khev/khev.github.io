1. Is big data the end of science? In a way we've been retreating for ages. Once we considered a problem solved if we had f(x). Then we only care about lim_t->infty, f(x). Then in GR, we only care about if a solution exists. Then probability.... 

2. Maybe big data is just another step backwards. Or is it fundamentally different? We don't even have the equations now; but maybe that's OK.
