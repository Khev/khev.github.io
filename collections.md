Here I'm keeping track of articles / news / links that I find interesting.

[**Seeing around corners**](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/04/seeing-around-corners/302471/) <br/>
This is a fantastic article on the power, purpose, and purview of modeling in the social sciences (and minimal models more generally). I really liked the line "The rise and refinement of artificial societies [i.e. minimal models] is not going to be a magic mirror, but it promises some hope of seeing, however dimly, around the next corner."


[**Letter to an aspiring intellectual**](https://www.firstthings.com/article/2018/05/letter-to-an-aspiring-intellectual) <br/>
Great piece on the development of a researcher / intellect. I liked the line "Your gaze is drawn, a flirtation begins, you learn more, you find some interlocutors, and, sometimes before you know it, your topic is before you and your intellectual course is set. There’s no algorithm for this: It’ll happen or it won’t."
