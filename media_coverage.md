**Universal visitation law of human mobility** <br/>
Large datasets of human movement uncover a simple law between the distance people travel to locations and the number of revisits to that location. See news articles at [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01355-7), [Cosmos](https://cosmosmagazine.com/science/physics/new-universal-law-of-human-mobility/), [Sante Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/news-center/news/mobility-data-reveals-universal-law-visitation-cities), [University of Copenhagan](https://pure.itu.dk/portal/en/publications/the-universal-visitation-law-of-human-mobility(8eb815b2-d91b-4dae-b132-3bfb2dcd58e6)/export.html), [Cosmos](https://cosmosmagazine.com/science/physics/new-universal-law-of-human-mobility/), [Science daily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/05/210526115600.htm), [Opera news](https://www.dailyadvent.com/news/634d46a27f2395fe8d541d6586e34331-The-universal-visitation-law-of-human-mobility), [My droll](https://mydroll.com/mobility-data-reveals-universal-law-of-visitation-in-cities/), and [MIT news](https://news.mit.edu/2021/travel-pattern-global-0526).

**Pulse-coupled oscillators** <br/>
Heart cells, sensor networks, and earthquakes get in sync by firing sudden pulses. What does the "route to synchrony" look like? See [here](http://physics.aps.org/synopsis-for/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.064101).


**Swarmalators** <br/>
Fireflies can sync. Fish can swarm -- what can both sync and swarm? Find out in [this](https://phys.org/news/2017-11-mathematician-swarmalators-future-science.html) Phys.org article, and [this](https://sinews.siam.org/Details-Page/self-organization-in-space-and-time) SIAM news article. Soft robots also exhibit swarmalator phenomena [here](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/03/210316112319.htm).
