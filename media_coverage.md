**Universal visitation law of human mobility** <br/>
Large datasets of human movement uncover a simple law between the distance people travel to locations and the number of revisits to that location  See [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01355-7)

**The sensing power of vehicle fleets** <br/>

**Pulse-coupled oscillators** <br/>
Heart cells, sensor networks, and earthquakes get in sync by firing sudden pulses. What does the "route to synchrony" look like? See [here](http://physics.aps.org/synopsis-for/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.064101).


**Swarmalators** <br/>
Fireflies can sync. Fish can swarm. But what can sync and swarm? Find out in [this](https://phys.org/news/2017-11-mathematician-swarmalators-future-science.html) Phys.org article, and [this](https://sinews.siam.org/Details-Page/self-organization-in-space-and-time) SIAM news article. Soft robots also exhibit swarmalator phenomena [here](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/03/210316112319.htm).
