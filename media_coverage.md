How many taxis does it take to scan a city? Find out [here](http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2019/06/how-many-taxis-can-scan-city-fewer-youd-think).


**Pulse-coupled oscillators** <br/>
Heart cells, sensor networks, and earthquakes get in sync by firing sudden pulses. What does the "route to synchrony" look like? Find out [here](http://physics.aps.org/synopsis-for/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.064101).


**Swarmalators** <br/>
Fireflies can sync. Fish can swarm. But what can sync and swarm? Find out in [this](https://phys.org/news/2017-11-mathematician-swarmalators-future-science.html) Phys.org article, and [this](https://sinews.siam.org/Details-Page/self-organization-in-space-and-time) SIAM news article.
