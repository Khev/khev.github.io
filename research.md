**Universal visitation law of human mobility**

Human mobility patterns are surprisingly simple. In spite of many hard to model effects like individual preferences, socioeconomic activities, and eviromental conditions, net migration flows between different locations obey a universal ["radiation" model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_law_for_human_mobility#:~:text=type%20of%20network.-,The%20radiation%20model,of%20people%20between%20different%20locations.). Here we show that the spectrum of these flows -- defined as the number of individuals that visit a given location with frequency *f* from a distance *r* away -- are also universal: they obey a simple inverse square law in the product *rf*.

**The sensing power of vehicle fleets**

Monitoring urban environments is a challenging task; air pollution, road quality, congestion, and other quantities of interest vary widely across both time and space, requiring much effort to accurately monitor. Here we show attaching sensors to third party urban vehicles -- like cars, taxis, buses or trucks -- could offer a cheap and scalable solution to this problem.

**Swarmalators: oscillators that sync and swarm**

Clocks, hearts, and lasers synchronize their behavior in time. Birds, fish, and insects swarm as groups in space. This project is about entities which coordinates themselves in both space and time. Physical examples of "swaramalators" -- short for swarming oscillators -- include groups of sperm, colloids of magentic Janus particles, and groups of Japanese tree frogs. Swarmalators have also been realized in the lab: [2D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUp_5bMMqXE), [2D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4zEgVMSsA) & [3D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Db6aiSa4soU&feature=youtu.be) and have been used as inspiration for making music![Link 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N85Og0TxyNo) [link 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq0JKNig37s).

**Pulse coupled oscillators**

During every heartbeat, thousands of pacemaker cells discharge all-at-once. This collective firing contracs the cardiac muscles which pumps blood around the body. This paper studies how the cells manage to synchronize their discharges -- how they keep the heart beating.

**The curious tourist problem**

A puzzle for probability theorists: 

A curious tourist arrives in a city with *N* roads arranged in a network *G*. She decides to explore the city by taking taxis to randomly chosen locations (via  shortest paths). After being dropped off by a taxi at a given location, she is immediately picked up by another taxi and brought to a new location. How long does it take her to cover every road at least once? Here we  numerically explore the curious tourist problem (and other aspects of the taxi-drive, the stochastic process implied by the puzzle), but an analytic solution remains elusive.

**The darkweb: a social network anomaly**

The darkweb is [unusual](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14023). About 87% of its sites never link to another site. To call it a "web" is thus a misnomer -- it's better described as a set of largely isolated dark silos. This topology is highly dissimilar to other social networks and indicates darkweb users behave much differently to www users. Preferential attachment can partially explain the strange topology of the darkweb, but a more accurate model based on the social behavior of its users is lacking.
